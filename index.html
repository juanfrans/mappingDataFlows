      <p class="mh3">Apple takes pain to position itself as going above and beyond with regard to privacy and protecting users' data.
      However, its Privacy Policy is extremely vague and open to interpretation, affording Apple the ability to collect and
      use vast amounts of customer data.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case1_2Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase1_2Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">This is important for two reasons. First, Apple’s privacy policy explicitly states that it "may collect, use, transfer,
      and disclose non-personal information for any purpose." That’s pretty much all information beyond your name and contact
      information. It collects data about everything you do on or with your phone - everywhere you go, which apps you interact
      with, who you talk to the most, even your health data - and use it for whatever they want, including advertising. Even
      personal data can be used to "create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and
      advertising," which includes almost every purpose we identified in our visualization. Apple may take precautions to
      protect users' data, but it can collect and use it with very few limitations.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case1_3Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase1_3Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">Secondly, Apple is only legally bound by its Privacy Policy, not representations made in its own marketing or keynote
      speeches. Apple keeps their privacy policy purposely vague - allowing it to continually "collect, use, transfer, and
      disclose" vast amounts of customer data while protecting itself from liability and lawsuits. In 2013 <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1581&context=historical" class="white underline">Apple was sued</a> by a
      group of people who claimed they relied on Apple's privacy claims when they purchased iPhones, but that Apple was still
      collecting and sharing data. The judge ruled that even though statements were vague and misleading, no one could prove
      that they actually read the policy, therefore they could not have been misled (yes, you read that right). Because the
      Privacy Policy is the only legally binding statement, the case was dismissed, and Apple didn't have to change any
      practices. Apple - and the tech industry - is counting on customers to believe their carefully constructed narratives
      around privacy - but leaning on a legal defense that essentially boils down to this: No one reads, much less
      understands, their privacy policies or terms of services.</p>

  <div id="case2_1Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase2_1Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">On Facebook, as with all online services, personally identifiable information (PII) like Social Security Numbers, date
      of birth, and gender are regulated and protected. In addition, users can control the app’s access to GPS location,
      cameras, and contact lists.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case2_2Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase2_2Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">However, even when you turn the privacy settings to the most extreme, Facebook can track all the content you view or
      interact with, down to scroll times and and cursor movements. The company can still collect the unique identifiers that
      tie users to their electronic devices and, even with GPS enabled, pinpoint user locations through cell phone towers and
      nearby WiFi networks.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case2_3Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase2_3Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">Thanks to big data, Amazon knows if shoppers are pregnant before they do. In the same way, Facebook can learn more about
      a user through their behavior than any information a user profile could provide--regardless of privacy settings. Unlike
      PII, Facebook is free to share this device and behavior information with third parties for any purpose.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case3_1Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">

      <span class="nextCase3_1Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">My boyfriend and I were "light" users of Facebook and Instagram, and we’d been dating for eight months. We weren’t in
      any pictures together, with no indication of our relationship status, and we’d never posted on each other’s Facebook
      walls. The most social media action between us was “liking” each other’s occasional Instagram photos.<br><br>
      One day, he mentioned (verbally) how he had been considering moving to Boerum Hill in Brooklyn. I had never heard of
      Boerum Hill. It sounded far away. But I never pressed it further, nor did I look it up. We never texted about it either.<br><br>
      One day later, I was served a few ads for gyms in Boerum Hill. While we had no intention of moving in together, Facebook
      insinuated that I might be moving there with erie precision - as if it was in the room with us during our conversation.<br><br>
      It certainly feels as if Facebook were listening in on our conversation, and by all rights (literally), the company
      could very well could (we dare you to find in their terms of service where it says that they can’t). However, it takes a
      lot of resources to listen to billions of conversations at scale, then turn them into advertisable objects (and a
      potential PR nightmare). What’s actually going on is far more pedestrian. For Facebook, it works like this:</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case3_2Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase3_2Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">Facebook tracks what you click on, share, buy, search, and converse about online.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case3_3Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase3_3Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">It then identifies people you're close to (in any number of ways), and also tracks the same information. (Facebook knows
      where you are, and it also knows where the people you are connected to are located.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case3_4Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase3_4Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">Facebook can then bucket you into advertising categories similar to people like you, again, based on what you click on,
      share, buy, search, and converse about online.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="case3_5Modal" class="modal dn fixed left-0 top-0 w-100 h-100 robotoMono">
    <div class="modal-content ph4 pv3 ba b--none br2 w-60 f5">
      <span class="nextCase3_5Modal fr f2 robotoMono pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh3">Facebook’s nearly inscrutable algorithms mix all this information together, and use it to serve ads it believes will be
      most relevant to you - and to friends with shared interests. It’s not a new concept - birds of a feather, after all. But
      what is jarring is the precision with which assumptions are made. People tend to talk “out loud” about the same things
      they interact with online. Facebook’s extraordinary data gathering machine simply takes it from there.</p>
