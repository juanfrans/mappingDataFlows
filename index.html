      <p class="mh4 ph3">Apple takes pain to position itself as going above and beyond with regard to privacy and protecting users' data.
      However, its Privacy Policy is extremely vague and open to interpretation, affording Apple the ability to collect and
      use vast amounts of customer data.</p>

      <span class="mh2 nextCase1_2Modal fr f2 pointer no-underline">></span>
      <p class="mh4 ph3">This is important for two reasons. First, Apple’s privacy policy explicitly states that it "may collect, use, transfer,
      and disclose non-personal information for any purpose." That’s pretty much all information beyond your name and contact
      information. It collects data about everything you do on or with your phone - everywhere you go, which apps you interact
      with, who you talk to the most, even your health data - and use it for whatever they want, including advertising. Even
      personal data can be used to "create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and
      advertising," which includes almost every purpose we identified in our visualization. Apple may take precautions to
      protect users' data, but it can collect and use it with very few limitations.</p>

      <span class="mh2 nextCase1_3Modal fr f2 pointer no-underline">x</span>
      <p class="mh4 ph3">Secondly, Apple is only legally bound by its Privacy Policy, not representations made in its own marketing or keynote
      speeches. Apple keeps their privacy policy purposely vague - allowing it to continually "collect, use, transfer, and
      disclose" vast amounts of customer data while protecting itself from liability and lawsuits. In 2013 <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1581&context=historical" class="white underline" target="_blank">Apple was sued</a> by a
      group of people who claimed they relied on Apple's privacy claims when they purchased iPhones, but that Apple was still
      collecting and sharing data. The judge ruled that even though statements were vague and misleading, no one could prove
      that they actually read the policy, therefore they could not have been misled (yes, you read that right). Because the
      Privacy Policy is the only legally binding statement, the case was dismissed, and Apple didn't have to change any
      practices. Apple - and the tech industry - is counting on customers to believe their carefully constructed narratives
      around privacy - but leaning on a legal defense that essentially boils down to this: No one reads, much less
      understands, their privacy policies or terms of services.</p>

      <p class="mh4 ph3">I consider myself a "light" user of Facebook and Instagram, by which I mean that I interact with the platform by
      browsing and clicking exclusively. I don’t upload photos, create posts, write articles and keep the information in my
      biography minimal.<br><br>I had been dating someone for about six months and suddenly noticed that we were getting very similar ads.
      We weren’t in any pictures together, there was no indication of our relationship status, and never interacted with each other’s
      Facebook activity or walls.<br><br>One day, he mentioned (verbally) how he had been considering moving to Boerum Hill in Brooklyn.
      I had never heard of Boerum Hill. It sounded far away. But I never pressed it further, nor did I look it up. We never texted about
      it either. One day later, I was served a few ads for gyms in Boerum Hill. While we had no intention of moving in together, Facebook
      insinuated that I might be moving there with erie precision - as if it was in the room with us during our conversation.<br><br>It
      certainly feels as if Facebook were listening in on our conversation, and by all rights (literally), the company
      could very well could (we dare you to find in their terms of service where it says that they can’t). However, it takes a
      lot of resources to listen to billions of conversations at scale, then turn them into advertisable objects (and a
      potential PR nightmare). What’s actually going on is far more pedestrian. For Facebook, it works like this:</p>

      what is jarring is the precision with which assumptions are made. People tend to talk “out loud” about the same things
      they interact with online. Facebook’s extraordinary data gathering machine simply takes it from there.</p>

      <p class="mh4 ph3">Privacy policies and terms of service are written for lawyers and courts, not regular people and certainly not for
      computers (we learned this as we tried to turn them into a data driven visualization!). But one thing about these
      documents is simple to grasp: Their language is maddeningly vague and imprecise.<br><br>
      Sometimes, a privacy policy does make a specific point, like when Amazon states with absolute precision:</p>
      <p class="mh4 ph3 gold f7">Currently showing all data for all companies.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="mh4 ph3">“We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.”<br><br>
      In this case it’s pretty clear what data you are surrendering to use their product. But when it’s time to offer up an
      explanation of what that data will be used for, Amazon suddenly becomes less concrete and instead only offers a few
      open-ended use-cases.<br><br>
      “We use the information that you provide for <i><strong>such purposes as</strong></i> responding to your requests, customizing future
      shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.”<br><br>
      So how does this work in practice? In recent news, two former Amazon employees laid bare the company’s practice of using
      data collected from vendors to create their own product line, including brands like Amazon Basics.</p>

      <p class="mh4 ph3">According to <a class="underline white" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-uses-thirdparty-sellers-data-to-build-private-labels-145813238.html" target="_blank">Krystal Hu at Yahoo Finance</a>,
      Amazon employees were “…able to analyze various datasets from the
      marketplaces, including the list of top-selling and trending products in certain categories, pricing points, return data
      and reviews.”<br><br>
      They could also “view aggregated data such as search interest and also pull reports from Amazon’s data warehouse on
      specific products to help them decide what Amazon should make.”<br><br>
      Insights created from that data were then used to find the ideal product to reverse engineer and produce it under one of
      Amazon’s in-house brand names.<br><br>
      Amazon may be vague about what it will do with your data, but it is specific about what you can do with theirs. The
      <a class="underline white" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201909000" target="_blank">Conditions of Use</a>
